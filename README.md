# SortViz
Sorting Visualizer

## About
This is a sorting visualizer. It is based on angular and shows precisely how different sorting algoriths works internally using animations.
The project can be tweaked by changing the animation speed and the nuber of eleents in array.

## Known bugs
Animations go haywire after a reset. Not merge sort though.
